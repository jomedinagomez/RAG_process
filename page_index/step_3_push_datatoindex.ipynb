Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (\"Al\") software provider with healthcare and enterprise Al experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.\\\\nThe allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of December 31, 2022.

Item 1\\\\nAs of March 31, 2023, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $5.0 billion and $21.9 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2030 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years.\\\\nNOTE 14 - CONTINGENCIES\\\\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation\\\\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\\\\\\'s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\"FCC Guidelines\") are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\\\\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\\\\\\' expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\\\\\\' motion to exclude the plaintiffs\\\\\\' general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022.\\\\nOther Contingencies\\\\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\\\\\\'s view of these matters may change in the future.\\\\nAs of March 31, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $177 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\\\\nNOTE 15 - STOCKHOLDERS\\\\\\' EQUITY\\\\nShare Repurchases\\\\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in February 2020 and was completed in November 2021.\\\\nOn September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases.

Item 2\\\\nIndustry Trends\\\\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\\\\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\\\\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\\\\\\'s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\\\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\\\\\\'s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\\\\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\\\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023.\\\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\\\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\\\nSeasonality\\\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\\\n33 \\', \\'title\\': \\'Industry Trends\\', \\'page_num\\': 33, \\'key_value\\': [], \\'@search.score\\': 0.027272727340459824, \\'@search.reranker_score\\': nan}, {\\'content\\': \\'PART !

The remaining transition tax of $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months.\\\\nProvisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes.\\\\nShare Repurchases\\\\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 55 million shares and 67 million shares of our common stock for $13.8 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of March 31, 2023, $26.9 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 15 - Stockholders\\\\\\' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.\\\\nDividends\\\\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.68 per share and $0.62 per share, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 15 - Stockholders\\\\\\' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.\\\\nOther Planned Uses of Capital\\\\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (\"Activision Blizzard\") for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard\\\\\\'s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard\\\\\\'s shareholders. We are continuing to engage with regulators reviewing the transaction and are working toward closing it in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\\\\n46 \\', \\'title\\': \\'PART I Item 2\\', \\'page_num\\': 46, \\'key_value\\': [\\'June 30, 2023: $ 17,505\\', \\'September 30, 2023: 9,695\\', \\'December 31, 2023: 7,025\\', \\'March 31, 2024: 2,678\\', \\'Thereafter: 2,698\\', \\'Total: $ 39,601\\'], \\'@search.score\\': 0.028594771400094032, \\'@search.reranker_score\\': nan}, {\\'content\\': \\'Exhibit 15.1\\\\nApril 25, 2023 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052-6399\\\\nWe are aware that our report dated April 25, 2023, on our review of the interim financial information of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (\"Microsoft\") appearing in Microsoft\\\\\\'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, is incorporated by reference in Registration Statement Nos. 333-109185, 333-118764, 333-52852, 333-132100, 333-161516, 333- 75243, 333-185757, and 333-221833 on Form S-8 and Registration Statement Nos. 333-240227 and 333-261590 on Form S-3.\\\\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\\\nSeattle, Washington \\', \\'title\\': \\'Exhibit 15.1\\', \\'page_num\\': 69, \\'key_value\\': [], \\'@search.score\\': 0.04510830342769623, \\'@search.reranker_score\\': 1.9442880153656006}]'}]\n",
