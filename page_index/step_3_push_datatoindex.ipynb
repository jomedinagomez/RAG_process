Item 1\\\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\\\nAccounting Principles\\\\nOur unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 28, 2022.\\\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\\\\nEstimates and Assumptions\\\\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\\\\\\'s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\\\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $885 million and net income of $720 million, or $0.10 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $2.9 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.32 and $0.31 per basic and diluted share, respectively.\\\\nFinancial Instruments\\\\nInvestments\\\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\\\\n8 \\', \\'title\\': \\'Title: NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\', \\'@search.score\\': 0.03452153131365776, \\'@search.reranker_score\\': 3.006587028503418}, {\\'page_num\\': 30, \\'key_value\\': [], \\'content\\': \\'PART !
