This segment primarily comprises:  \n\u2022 Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.  \n\u2022 Devices, including Surface, Hololens, and PC accessories.  \n\u2022 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, third-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.  \n\u2022 Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"28\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1\" -->  \nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  \nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.  \nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:  \n| (In millions) | Three Months Ended March 31, || Nine Months Ended March 31, ||\n| | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |\n| - | - | - | - | - |\n| Revenue | | | | |\n| Productivity and Business Processes | $ 17,516 | $ 15,789 | $ 50,983 | $ 46,764 |\n| Intelligent Cloud | 22,081 | 18,987 | 63,914 | 54,161 |\n| More Personal Computing | 13,260 | 14,584 | 40,829 | 45,480 |\n| Total | $ 52,857 | $ 49,360 | $ 155,726 | $ 146,405 |\n| Operating Income | | | | |\n| Productivity and Business Processes | $ 8,639 | $ 7,185 | $ 25,137 | $ 22,454 |\n| Intelligent Cloud | 9,476 | 8,391 | 27,358 | 24,395 |\n| More Personal Computing | 4,237 | 4,788 | 11,774 | 16,000 |\n| Total | $ 22,352 | $ 20,364 | $ 64,269 | $ 62,849 |  \nNo sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the three or nine months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022.
