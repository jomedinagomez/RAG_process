{"title":"STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY STATEMENTS","header1":"Financial Instruments","content":"Financial Instruments\/n### Investments  \nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"8\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->  \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and\/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  \nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  \n#### Derivatives  \nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.","summary":"### Summary of Financial Instruments and Investments from 10-K Document\n\n**Investments Classification:**\n- **Cash Equivalents:** Highly liquid interest-earning investments with maturities of three months or less at purchase are classified as cash equivalents, with fair values approximating carrying values.\n- **Short-Term Investments:** Investments with original maturities over three months but less than one year are classified as short-term. Those with maturities beyond one year may also be classified as short-term if they are highly liquid and available for current operations.\n\n**Debt Investments:**\n- Classified as available-for-sale, with realized gains and losses recorded using the specific identification method.\n- Changes in fair value (excluding credit losses) are recorded in other comprehensive income.\n- Fair value is determined using market information or management estimates. If the cost exceeds fair value, an evaluation is conducted considering market conditions and credit quality.\n- Impairment charges are recorded if the investment is expected to be sold before recovery.\n\n**Equity Investments:**\n- Readily determinable fair value investments are measured at fair value.\n- Investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or at cost, with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments.\n- Periodic qualitative assessments are performed to recognize impairments if fair value is less than carrying value.\n\n**Derivatives:**\n- Recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.\n- **Fair Value Hedges:** Gains and losses are recognized in other income, offsetting gains\/losses on hedged items.\n- **Cash Flow Hedges:** Gains and losses are initially reported in other comprehensive income and later recognized in other income with the hedged item.\n- **Non-Hedged Derivatives:** Changes in fair value are recognized in other income. \n\nThis summary encapsulates the key points regarding the classification and accounting treatment of various financial instruments and
