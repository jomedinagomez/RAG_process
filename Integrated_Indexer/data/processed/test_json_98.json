{"title":"PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS","header1":"Development and deployment of defensive measures","content":"Development and deployment of defensive measures\/nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers' systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services.  \nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  \nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  \nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"56\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 1A\" -->  \nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.","summary":"The 10-K document outlines the company's commitment to enhancing security measures for its internal IT systems, cloud-based services, and customer systems. Key points include:\n\n1. **Continuous Improvement**: The company must consistently develop secure products, enhance security features, and improve software update deployment to address vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Customer Requirements**: Certain industries, like financial services and healthcare, have specialized security needs that the company must meet.\n\n3. **Cost Implications**: Implementing security measures may reduce operating margins. Failure to adequately address security could harm the company's reputation, leading to reduced customer purchases or shifts to competitors.\n\n4. **Customer Responsibility**: Customers may neglect to update their systems or adopt necessary security practices, which could negatively impact the company's reputation and revenue.\n\n5. **Liability Risks**: Security vulnerabilities in third-party components could lead to increased costs, liability claims, and reputational damage.\n\n6. **Data Privacy Concerns**: The company processes large amounts of personal data, and breaches could lead to legal exposure and reputational harm. There are concerns about unauthorized use of data by third parties.\n\n7. **Government Requests**: The company may be compelled to disclose customer data under legal orders, which could affect customer trust and sales.\n\n8. **Information Protection**: The company faces challenges in protecting valuable information from unauthorized access or use, which could diminish the value of its products and services.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of robust security measures while acknowledging the potential costs and risks associated with data protection and customer
