{"title":"STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY STATEMENTS","header1":"Fair Value Measurements","content":"Fair Value Measurements\/nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:  \n\u2022 Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"9\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->  \n\u2022 Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.  \n\u2022 Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  \nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  \nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  \n### Contract Balances and Other Receivables  \nAs of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, other receivables due from suppliers were $717 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nAs of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, our financing receivables, net were $2.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.","summary":"The 10-K document outlines the company's approach to fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities, categorizing them into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in the valuation:\n\n1. **Level 1**: Fair value is determined using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. This includes U.S. government securities, common and preferred stocks, mutual funds, and actively traded derivatives.\n\n2. **Level 2**: Fair value is based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or model-based techniques where all significant inputs are observable. This includes investments like commercial paper, U.S. agency securities, and certain derivatives.\n\n3. **Level 3**: Fair value relies on unobservable inputs, often based on management's estimates. This includes corporate notes, municipal securities, and goodwill\/intangible assets recorded at fair value due to impairment.\n\nThe company measures equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis, using various valuation techniques. Other current financial assets and liabilities are reported at fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\nAdditionally, as of March 31, 2023, the company reported:\n- Other receivables from suppliers at $717 million (down from $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2022).\n- Long-term accounts receivable at $4.3 billion (up from $3.8 billion).\n- Financing receivables of $2.7 billion (down from $4.1 billion), with allowances for expected losses based on historical data and current
