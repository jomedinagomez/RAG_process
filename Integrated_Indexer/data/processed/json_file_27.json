{"title":"NOTE 7 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS","header":"Uncertain Tax Positions","content":"NOTE 7 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\/nUncertain Tax Positions\/nAs of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $18.1 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  \nAs of March 31, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1\" -->  \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  \nNOTE 12 - UNEARNED REVENUE  \nUnearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \n(In millions)  \n| | March 31, 2023 | June 30, 2022 |\n| - | - | - |\n| Productivity and Business Processes | $ 20,504 | $ 24,558 |\n| Intelligent Cloud | 15,552 | 19,371 |\n| More Personal Computing | 3,545 | 4,479 |\n| Total | $ 39,601 | $ 48,408 |\n| Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: | | |\n| (In millions) | | |\n| Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 | | |\n| Balance, beginning of period | | $ 48,408 |\n| Deferral of revenue | | 78,046 |\n| Recognition of unearned revenue | | (86,853) |\n| Balance, end of period | | $ 39,601 |  \nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $201 billion as of March 31, 2023, of which $196 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue.
