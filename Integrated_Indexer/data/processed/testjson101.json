{"title":"PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS","header1":"LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS","content":"LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\/nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"58\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 1A\" -->  \nThe European Commission (\"the Commission\") closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission's concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.  \nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  \nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \n\u2022 We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.  \n\u2022 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property.  \n\u00b7 We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions.  \n\u2022 Our ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.  \n\u2022 Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of such transactions.  \nOur global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"59\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 1A\" -->  \nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.  \nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments' approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  \nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products and services is an important aspect of this goal. In addition to existing and upcoming laws requiring digital accessibility for people with disabilities, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.  \nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.  \n### Cross-border transfer of personal data  \nThe growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities blocking the use of U.S .- based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The U.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. In December 2022, the European Commission published a draft \"adequacy\" determination for this new framework. A failure to finalize implementation of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or the framework's invalidation in EU courts, could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.  \n<!-- PageNumber=\"60\" -->  \n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 1A\" -->","summary":"### Summary of Legal, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\n\nThe company faces significant legal and regulatory scrutiny related to competition laws in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, and China. This scrutiny impacts product design and marketing strategies, particularly for high-volume products like Windows. Past actions by the European Commission have mandated changes to product offerings and interoperability commitments, which may hinder innovation and increase development costs.\n\nThe company also navigates complex relationships with OEM partners, balancing cooperation and competition, which raises compliance risks. Regulatory actions could lead to fines, product withdrawals, or the need to alter products, potentially affecting revenue and market competitiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the company is subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which require accurate record-keeping and compliance with international standards. Non-compliance could result in severe penalties and reputational damage.\n\nTrade laws and sanctions further complicate operations, especially in politically sensitive regions. Compliance with evolving regulations on user privacy, data protection, and telecommunications is critical, as failure to adhere could lead to penalties and operational disruptions.\n\nThe company is also under pressure to enhance product accessibility and comply with laws regarding personal data handling. Recent legal developments, such as the invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework for data transfers between the EU and the U.S., create uncertainty and could complicate international
