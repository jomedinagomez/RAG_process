      "on 30: The text discusses potential legal and regulatory challenges related to data transfers from the EU to the U.S., and the implementation of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. It also mentions the impact of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data regulations on the company's operations, including potential penalties for non-compliance. The company's business with government customers, which presents additional uncertainties, is also mentioned. The text further discusses potential additional tax liabilities, including the impact of audits by tax authorities and changes in tax laws. Finally, it mentions the company's significant operating income outside the U.S., which could be affected by changes in tax rates or business structure.\n",
      "on 31: The text discusses potential risks to the company's financial status and intellectual property. The company is under audit by the IRS for prior tax years, primarily regarding transfer pricing. Changes in tax laws or disputes could affect the company's effective tax rates and financial statements. The company's source code is crucial to its business, and unauthorized disclosure could lead to loss of trade secret protection and increased competition. The company's intellectual property rights are difficult to protect globally, and changes in law could weaken their ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing their patents. Third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual property rights, which could lead to less favorable royalty and licensing agreements, product redesign, or payment of damages. Damage to the company's reputation or brands could negatively impact revenues or margins. Adverse economic or market conditions could lead to lower IT spending and affect the company's revenue. The company's distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network, and challenging economic conditions could disrupt this.\n",

These include damage to the company's reputation, adverse economic conditions, disruptions in product distribution, and customer payment issues. It also mentions the risks associated with an investment portfolio, catastrophic events, geopolitical instability, and global pandemics. The company's operations are also exposed to risks due to climate change, international business operations, and the need to attract and retain talented employees.\n",
      "on 33: The text discusses potential risks to the company's operations due to changes in trade policies, environmental and political conditions, and the competitive market for skilled workers. It also mentions the company's dependence on attracting and retaining diverse talent, and the potential impact of immigration laws on staffing. The company's share repurchases and dividends for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 are detailed, with a total return of $9.7 billion to shareholders. The document also includes certifications from the CEO and CFO in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n",
