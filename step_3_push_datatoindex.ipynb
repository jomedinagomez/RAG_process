Item 1\\\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation\\\\nResults of Review of Interim Financial Information\\\\nWe have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of March 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\\\\\\' equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"interim financial information\"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\\\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\\\\\\' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 28, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\\\\nBasis for Review Results\\\\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company\\\\\\'s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\\\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.

      "The updated answer, including the new context, is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Microsoft's competitors are developing new software and devices, and deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Microsoft must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Microsoft's increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. They are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy their cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. Their success in the Internet of Things (IoT) will depend on the level of adoption of their offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IOT Edge, and Azure Sphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The investments Microsoft is making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase their operating costs and may decrease their operating margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Microsoft's success is highly dependent on their ability to attract and retain qualified employees. They compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit their ability to adequately staff their research and development efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Aggregate demand for Microsoft's software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non- local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell their products in foreign countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Microsoft's devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, Microsoft has limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet their requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in Microsoft's ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Microsoft's international operations provide a significant portion of their total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Microsoft announced decisions to align their cost structure with their revenue and customer demand, prioritize their investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. This resulted in a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to their hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. They reduced their overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of their total employee base. They are also consolidating their leases to create higher density across their workspaces, which will also impact their financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and they may make similar decisions in future periods as they continue to evaluate their real estate needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Microsoft makes significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive their latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Microsoft's acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on their business. They expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of their long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance their business strategy, that they get an unsatisfactory return on their investment, that they have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from their other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. If Microsoft's goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, they may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. They acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Cybersecurity, data privacy, and platform abuse risks are significant. Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to Microsoft's reputation or competitive position. The security of their information technology and the security of their products, services, devices, and customers' data are crucial. Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms, and cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex. Microsoft's products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, Microsoft could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to their reputation or competitive position.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm Microsoft's reputation. As they continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of their cloud-based offerings, they store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of their customers and users. Despite their efforts to improve the security controls across their business groups and geographies, it is possible their security controls over personal data, their training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices they follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data they or their vendors store and manage.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Microsoft's online services could face excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions if they fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Their increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of their products and services demand more computing power. They spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade their technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on their websites and in their datacenters.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. The development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may result in reputational harm or liability. Microsoft is building AI into many of their offerings, including their productivity services, and they are also making AI available for their customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including their strategic partner, OpenAI. They expect these elements of their business to grow. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Microsoft's global operations subject them to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by their employees, vendors, or agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Microsoft's hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices they design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. They could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if they fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Microsoft's software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software they develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Their customers increasingly rely on them for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of their products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects they do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to their reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Their competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to them. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, they may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how they design and market their products. Government agencies closely scrutinize them under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Microsoft may be required to make available licenses to their proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect their associated intellectual property.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. Microsoft is subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions they have taken. If they fail to comply with these commitments, they may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Microsoft's ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit Microsoft's ability to consummate acquisitions or impose\n",
