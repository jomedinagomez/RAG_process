Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\\' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 28, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\\nBasis for Review Results\\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\\' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 29, 2021, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\\nBasis for Review Results\\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\nSeattle, Washington April 26, 2022\\n32 \\nPART I Item 2\\nITEM 2.

      "The risks factors associated with Microsoft in FY2023 Q3, in addition to the previously mentioned factors, include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Damage to brands or reputation: If Microsoft's brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact its revenues, margins, or ability to attract highly qualified employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Adverse economic or market conditions: Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect Microsoft's revenue. Declining demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices, or reduced consumer or business spending, could also impact revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sales channel disruption: Microsoft's product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. Economic conditions impacting partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Impaired ability to collect payments: Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of Microsoft's customers to pay for products and services, leading to increased allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Investment portfolio risks: Microsoft's investment portfolio is subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. Market downturns or events affecting global financial markets could adversely affect the portfolio, including U.S. government securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions: Disruptions or failures of Microsoft's systems or operations due to catastrophic events like earthquakes, weather events, cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, or pandemics could cause delays in sales, service provision, or critical functions. Geopolitical changes may impact operating strategies, access to markets, hiring, and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Regional epidemics or global pandemics: The occurrence of regional epidemics or global pandemics, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect Microsoft's operations, financial condition, and results. Measures to contain pandemics may intensify other risks and impact operations, compliance obligations, supply chain, international operations, and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Climate change and environmental regulations: The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in energy or resource availability may affect the availability or cost of goods and services necessary for Microsoft's business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Operational and economic risks of global business: Microsoft's global business exposes it to operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Economic developments, political disputes, and emerging trends may impact results. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may also affect Microsoft's operations.\n",
