      "\n",
      "### Accounting Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles\n",
      "generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial\n",
      "statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods\n",
      "presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in\n",
      "conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\n",
      "Commission on July 28, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Estimates and Assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\n",
      "liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and\n",
      "timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable\n",
      "consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or\n",
      "potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible\n",
      "assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates;\n",
      "when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our\n",
      "consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and\n",
      "outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that\n",
      "increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should\n",
      "increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate\n",
      "was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and\n",
      "equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in\n",
      "operating income of $885 million and net income of $720 million, or $0.10 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the\n",
      "nine months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $2.9 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.32 and $0.31 per\n",
      "basic and diluted share, respectively.\n",

      "### Financial Instruments\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Investments\n",
      "\n",
      "We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\n",
      "equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater\n",
      "than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities\n",
      "beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the\n",
      "investment of cash that is available for current operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- PageNumber=\"8\" -->\n",
      "<!-- PageBreak -->\n",

      "<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n",
      "\n",
      "Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.\n",
      "Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based\n",
      "on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value,\n",
      "we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value\n",
      "is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative\n",
      "evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we\n",
      "have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair\n",
      "value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\n",
      "If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair\n",
      "values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred\n",
      "to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are\n",
      "sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income\n",
      "(expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Derivatives\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value\n",
      "of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting\n",
      "gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are\n",
      "recognized in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive\n",
      "income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing\n",
      "hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other\n",
      "income (expense), net.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Fair Value Measurements\n",
      "\n",
      "We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which\n",
      "inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three\n",
      "levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n",
      "\n",
      "· Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\n",
      "include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities\n",
      "include those actively traded on exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- PageNumber=\"9\" -->\n",
      "<!-- PageBreak -->\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- PageHeader=\"PART I Item 1\" -->\n",
      "\n",
      "· Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\n",
      "instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\n",
      "significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\n",
      "the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\n",
      "value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward\n",
      "and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\n",
      "securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal\n",
      "securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward,\n",
      "option, and swap contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market\n",
      "participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques,\n",
      "including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in\n",
      "corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to\n",
      "an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are\n",
      "determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,\n",
      "and discounted cash flow projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n",
      "\n",
      "As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, other receivables due from suppliers were $717 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and are\n",
      "included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.3 billion and $3.8\n",

      "\n",
      "We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings\n",
      "through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, our financing receivables, net were\n",
      "$2.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and\n",

      "historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n",

      "#### Employee Severance\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of\n",
      "fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to\n",

      "##### Industry Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an\n",
      "opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,\n",
      "we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address\n",
      "the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\n",
      "software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors\n",
      "customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of\n",
      "cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The\n",
      "investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating\n",
      "margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent\n",
      "worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in\n",
      "resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n",
      "Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\n",
      "dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are\n",
      "very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor\n",
      "becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a\n",
      "similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\n",
      "denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and\n",
      "expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international\n",
      "operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our\n",
      "investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal\n",
      "year 2023 (\"Q2 charge\"), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our\n",
      "hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs\n",
      "through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some\n",
      "areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and\n",
      "long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our\n",
      "workspaces, which will also impact our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in\n",
      "future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\n",

      "##### Seasonality\n",
      "\n",
      "Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven\n",
      "by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is\n",
      "driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n",

      "##### Change in Accounting Estimate\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that\n",
      "increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should\n",
      "increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate\n",
      "was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and\n",
      "equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in\n",
      "operating income of $885 million and net income of $720 million, or $0.10 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change for the\n",
      "nine months ended March 31, 2023 was an increase in operating income of $2.9 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.32 and $0.31 per\n",
      "basic and diluted share, respectively. It is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 annual operating income by $3.7 billion.\n",

      "\n",

      "how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of\n",
      "this Form 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\n",

      "\n",
      "We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating\n",
      "margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Competition in the technology sector\n",
      "\n",
      "Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized\n",
      "firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to\n",
      "entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive\n",
      "technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our\n",
      "success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n",
      "\n",
      "An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse\n",
      "solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider\n",
      "that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We\n",
      "face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "· A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and\n",
      "related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles,\n",
      "wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the\n",
      "hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also\n",
      "be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated\n",
      "hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we\n",
      "increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n",

      "\n",
      "· We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from\n",
      "competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices\n",
      "compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning\n",
      "to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these\n",
      "devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract\n",
      "application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may\n",
      "decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their\n",
      "competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer\n",
      "(\"OEM\") partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility\n",
      "of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move\n",
      "data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to\n",
      "write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value.\n",
      "Efforts to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\n",
      "operating margins. Competitors' rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute\n",
      "products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Business model competition\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-\n",
      "based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting\n",
      "original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue\n",
      "received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers\n",
      "under this model.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party\n",
      "advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little\n",
      "cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and\n",
      "earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and\n",
      "development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such\n",
      "as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves\n",
      "cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-\n",
      "class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\"Al\"). At the same\n",
      "time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and\n",
      "delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user's choice of\n",
      "which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows\n",
      "ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability\n",
      "and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of\n",
      "Things (\"loT\"), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including Al. Our\n",
      "success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We\n",

      "those of our competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing\n",
      "organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new\n",
      "products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may\n",
      "negatively impact gross margins and operating income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts\n",
      "through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that\n",
      "violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to\n",
      "control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\n",
      "\n",
      "We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make\n",
      "significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows\n",
      "operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, Linkedin, and other products and services.\n",
      "We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including\n",
      "PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors,\n",
      "including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as\n",
      "providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades,\n",
      "unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for\n",
      "several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new\n",
      "products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain\n",
      "features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services\n",
      "will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\n",
      "product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or\n",
